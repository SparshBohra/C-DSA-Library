# C-DSA-Library
This is a standard-template-library created for C99. It includes commonly used data structures and algorithms.

🌟 Star it, 🍴 Fork it, 🤝 Contribute to it!

How can you contribute?
 - Help in documentations is always needed
 - Add more Data Structures & Algorithmic functions to the DSA.h file. 
 - The Data Structures only have linked-list implementations yet. Add implementations using arrays.
 - The DS & Algorithms are only implemented for int and char data types. Add custom data types as arguments for functions.
 
If contributing, maintain standard names for operations you are implementing. (DSA NAME)_(OPERATION)
